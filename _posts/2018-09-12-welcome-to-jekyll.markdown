There is a [big hurricane](https://weather.com/safety/hurricane/news/2018-09-13-hurricane-florence-forecast-carolinas-southeast-landfall) headed for the Carolinas today. 

Hurricanes are also called tropical storms. 

Here is [data](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/TCR_StormReportsIndex.xml) the number of tropical storms in the Atlantic and Pacific, from 1958 - 2018, though it looks like data on tropical storms in the Pacific is missing here. 

I created this graph of tropical storms in the Atlantic and Pacific, from 1958 to 2018, from [this data](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/TCR_StormReportsIndex.xml) using R (repo [here](https://github.com/gaced/data_tables/tree/master/tropicalStorms)).

Note: it looks like the data I'm using doesn't have information for the Pacific prior to 1988.

The trend lines show the number of tropical storms has been increasing in both basins.
